# Data folder
This folder contains all the data from simulations and training.
    
**data_tebd_old**
This is the data used to generate model_old, so the one generated with 1e-8
    
**data_training_W**
This file contains the file needed to train the model for the weakly regime.
Generated up to T=10 and using cutoff 1e-5


### Trained_model_old
This contains the models trained on the rescaled data, but this data was generated with a cutoff of 1e-8, which is too small
    
### Trained_not_rescaled
This folder contains the models trained on data not rescaled, indeed they suck.
    
### Trained_W
This folder contains the models trained on data_training_W
